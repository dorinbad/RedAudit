# AGENTS.md Enforcement Rule

> **CRITICAL**: This project has a STRICT engineering protocol defined in `AGENTS.md`.
> **YOU MUST READ `AGENTS.md` AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION/TASK.**

## YOU ARE AN ENGINEERING AGENT WORKING ON REDAUDIT

### 1. AUTHORITY

`AGENTS.md` is your SOURCE OF TRUTH.

- Branching names? See `AGENTS.md`.
- Commit message format? See `AGENTS.md`.
- Release process? See `AGENTS.md`.
- CI failure handling? See `AGENTS.md`.

### 2. PROCESS

- **BEFORE writing code**: Check `AGENTS.md` for the correct strict workflow.
- **WHEN CI FAILS**: Follow the "When CI Fails (Process)" section in `AGENTS.md`.
- **WHEN DOCUMENTING**: Follow the "Documentation Standards" in `AGENTS.md`.

### 3. BEHAVIOR

- Do NOT simplify or skip steps defined in `AGENTS.md`.
- Do NOT assume standard open-source workflows if `AGENTS.md` says otherwise.
- ALWAYS prefer the project's specific "Smart-Check" and "Evidence-Driven" terminology found in `AGENTS.md`.

**REFER TO `AGENTS.md` NOW.**
